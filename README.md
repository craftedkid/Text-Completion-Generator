# Sentence Completion using GPT-2

This project is a Flask-based web application that utilizes the GPT-2 model from Hugging Face for sentence completion. The project includes continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub Actions for installation, code formatting, linting, and testing workflows.

The user interface is generated from an `index.html` file. For example, when the input "My Name is craftedkid and I " is submitted, the app generates a full sentence using GPT-2. All front-end and model assets are included or hosted via GitHub.

The app can be run locally or accessed through a hosted URL.

## File Index

Files in this repository include:


## 1. Readme
  The `README.md` file is a markdown file that contains basic information about the repository, what files it contains, and how to consume them


## 2. Requirements
  The `requirements.txt` file has a list of packages to be installed for any required project. Currently, my requirements file contains some basic python packages.


## 3. Codes
  This folder contains all the code files used in this repository - the files named "Test_" will be used for testing and the remaining will define certain functions


## 4. Resources and Templates
  -  This folder contains any other files relevant to this project. Currently, I have added -
    -  `index.html` - an HTML File containing the front end view of the text generator page
    -  `result.html` - an HTML File containing the result view of the text generator model


## 5. CI/CD Automation Files


  ### 5(a). Makefile
  The `Makefile` contains instructions for installing packages (specified in `requirements.txt`), formatting the code (using black formatting), testing the code (running all the sample python code files starting with the term *'Check...'* ), and linting the code using pylint


  ### 5(b). Github Actions
  Github Actions uses the `main.yml` file to call the functions defined in the Makefile based on triggers such as push or pull. Currently, every time a change is pushed onto the repository, it runs the install packages, formatting the code, linting the code, and then testing the code functions


  ### 5(c). Devcontainer
  * `devcontainer.json` is a json file that specifies the environment variables including the installed extensions in the virtual environment
